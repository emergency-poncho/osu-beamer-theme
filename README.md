# Oregon State University Beamer Theme

## Description

Authors: Jeremy Lilly, Michael Kupperman

_A custom Beamer theme for Oregon State University._

## Usage

To use, place all five `.sty` files and the `osu_theme_images` directory into your working directory and add

`\usetheme{OSU}`

to the preamble of your main Beamer presentation `.tex` file.

### User Defined Macros

This theme allows the user to define the following macros that are used throughout the document:

- `title`
- `subtitle`
- `author`
- `department`
- `institute`
- `titlegrapic`

For example:

```latex
\title[Short Title]{Long Title}
\subtitle{Subtitle}
\author{Jane Doe\inst{1} \and John Doe\inst{2}}
\department{Mathematics}
\institute{
    \inst{1}Very Fancy University \\
    \inst{2}Another Fancy University
}
\titlegraphic{\includegraphics[scale=0.05]{images/placeholder.png}}
```

**Note:** Not all these must be defined. The user may define whichever they like, and the document will change appearance accordingly.

## Compilation

This theme uses OSU's official fonts, and as such should be complied with **LuaLaTeX** or **XeLaTeX**. Further, `Georgia` and `Verdana` must be installed fonts for the document to compile. 
When compiled on most LaTeX IDEs the command on line 1 on main.tex will override the default compiler choice in favor of LuaLaTeX.

However, if you do wish to compile with **pdfLaTeX**, you may do so, and the theme will use the LaTeX's default serif and sans-serif fonts in place of `Georgia` and `Verdana`.
Simply remove line 1 from `main.tex`.
